6. The calculation performed in the chaos program can be written in a number of ways that are algebraically equivalent. 
Write a version of the program for each of the following ways of doing the computation. Have your modified programs print out 
100 iterations of the calculation and compare the results when run on the same input.

a) 3.9 * x * (1 - x)
b) 3.9 * (x - x * x)
c) 3.9 * x - 3.9 * x * x

Explain the results of this experiment.
Between a,b, and c they were all different and had none of the same answers
