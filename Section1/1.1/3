3. Modify the chaos program using 2.0 in place of 3.9 as the multiplier in the logistic function. Your modified line of code should look like this:

x = 2.0 * x * (1 - x)

Run the program for various input values and compare the results to those obtained from the original program. Write a short paragraph describing
 any differences that you notice in the behavior of the two versions.

The chaos that we used before had more long random numbers and now we only have a few long random numbers and some short numbers that are 0.5.
